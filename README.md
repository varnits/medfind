This is a medicine scraper web app built using React.js for frontend and Node.js as backend. When you make a query for a medicine in the search box the backend server hits APIs of different medicine delivery sites and fetches the result in form of json objects. The backend then processes these json objects to get the details of the available medicines like the brand name, price etc. and sends the response to the frontend as json object which is finally displayed in the browser.
backend server is generated on http://localhost:5001 and an  GET api is created on http://localhost:5001/"query" which is triggered by frontend

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`
For first time

In the backend directory, you can run:
### `npm install`
For first time

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
This will start the frontend
To start backend server got to backend directory and  
### `node index`


This will start the backend server and listen at port 5001. for incoming requests.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
