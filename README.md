This is a medicine scraper web app built using React.js for frontend and Node.js as backend. When you make a query for a medicine in the search box the backend server hits APIs of different medicine delivery sites and fetches the result in form of json objects. The backend then processes these json objects to get the details of the available medicines like the brand name, price etc. and sends the response to the frontend as json object which is finally displayed in the browser.
backend server is generated on http://localhost:5001 and an  GET api is created on http://localhost:5001/"query" which is triggered by frontend

## Available Scripts

### `npm install`

In the backend directory, you can run:
